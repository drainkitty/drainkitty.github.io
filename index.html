<P>My name is Hazel. I am seventeen (and a half) years old and I love to overshare on the internet,
but I've grown a distaste for social media over the years, and started dumping my passions and thoughts
into my webpages instead! I have Always loved the idea of having my very own website, and made my first Neocities page
around 11.</p><p>I've been homeschooled for most of my life, and therefore have had a lot of free time for
my hobbies and passions! My favorite hobbies are <a href="https://mouseworld.neocities.org/gallery">drawing</a>,
 listening to and playing music, and coding. I can only code HTML, but I want to learn JavaScript
next. I also love animals, especially prehistoric ones. One of my favorite prehistoric animals
is Opabinia!<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/apqpVmK.png" width=20%>
